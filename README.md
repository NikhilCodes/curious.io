A sophisticated Q&amp;A platform.

### Tools used:
 - Java (Springboot) [**backend**]
 - Angular [**frontend**]
 - Postgresql [**database**]

### Getting Started

Make sure **JAVA_HOME** environment variable is set correctly.<br>
Run the below code inside *backend* dir,<br>
`$ ./mvnw spring-boot:run --quiet `

Now once it starts successfully, the backend server will be up and running.

Let's start the frontend as well by executing
```
$ npm i
$ npm start
```

This will start the angular frontend as soon as the build is complete.
